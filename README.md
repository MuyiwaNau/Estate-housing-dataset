# Estate Housing Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the exploratory analysis of estate housing data, aiming to gain insights and provide valuable information from the dataset. The analysis includes data visualization using `matplotlib,` and various plots and charts will be created to understand the dataset better.

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries as mentioned in the prerequisites.

Run the analysis script using Python.

View the generated plots and charts for insights into the estate housing data.


## Prerequisites

Before running the analysis, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- os
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using `pip`:


## Functions for Data Visualization
To begin this exploratory analysis, first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made.

## Data Visualization Functions
In this toolkit, you'll find the following data visualization functions:

### Scatter Plot
scatter_plot(x, y): This function creates a scatter plot using the specified x and y data.
Example usage:

```scatter_plot(x_data, y_data)```
### Bar Chart
bar_chart(categories, values): This function generates a bar chart with the given categories and corresponding values.
Example usage:

```bar_chart(categories_data, values_data)```

## Data Analysis
In this section, you can describe the key findings and insights from the data analysis. Include visualizations, tables, or charts that highlight important trends or patterns in the estate housing dataset.
